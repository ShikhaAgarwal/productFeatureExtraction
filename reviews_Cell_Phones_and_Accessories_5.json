My husband and my daughter both lost their original cables for their iPhones and they went the cheap route, buying a cheap replacement cable, I believe it messed up their battery memory because coincidentally both of them have battery hold/charge issues but my son and I do not. I used this cable to charge my husbands phone and it charged it from 3% to 100% in about an hour, that's about how long it takes my phone to charge but with the cheap cable his takes 2-1/2 hours. I'm thrilled with the quality of this cable, I'm hoping now that we have &#34;quality&#34; cables again, maybe the battery memory will improve on their phones.  Great cable at a great price. I definitely recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Real quality", "unixReviewTime": 1405900800, "reviewTime": "07 21, 2014"}
